<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Porco Rosso</h3>

<p>It is about a man named Marco Pagot who was cursed and turned to 
    look like a pig. It is set during the uprising of Fascism in Italy 
    (1920s). He flies his Seaplane in the Adriatic Sea as a Bounty Hunter
    against Seaplane Pirates. The movie supports Anti-Fascisim and 
    Feminism. For example, Porco explicitly says that he hates Fascisim.
    I like how he reflects the Sexism that becomes progressive towards 
    Feminism by being convinced by his fellow Mechanic Piccolo who 
    entrusts his granddaugther Fio to help repair his plane when it 
    gets shot down by a foreign hired Pilot from the Pirates. The movie
    has beautiful music and animation that resonates really well 
    with how peaceful it is flying or intense it is being in a dogfight 
    as depicted in Porco's past from a third person view during World War
    I.

<h3>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</h3>

<p>It is about a young man who is in his young 20s, his 
    name is Scott Pilgrim, starts dating someone named Ramona Flowers.
    After Scott starts dating her, he has to face the League of Seven 
    Evil Exes who are trying to stop him from getting with Ramona. 
    So if Scott stops all Seven of Ramona's Exes he gets to keep her. 
    What I like about this movie is that Scott and Ramona are both 
    horrible human beings who treated their exes like trash but are 
    oblivious to the damage that they caused to them. So Scott is on a 
    quest of self discovery. And while on this self discovery, the 
    nice small touches of videogame references and elements mixed into
    the univers of Scott Pilgrim makes it feel natural, nothing feels 
    forced/out of place, it all just makes sense. The music and pacing 
    of the movie make it also entertaining, plus there are some areas 
    within the movie that is way better than the book counter park. For 
    example, there was a part in the book where the fight with one of the 
    Evil Exes was boring but the movie made it more entertaining. 
    Please give Scott Pilgrim a watch, it really is a unique movie that 
    no one else has replicated it in the movie world. The only show
    equivalent to Scott Pilgrim out of the top of my head is 
    Videogame Highschool by RocketJump.

<h3>Im Westen nichts Neues</h3>
<p>This movie is on Netflix and it is about World War I from the
    perspective of Paul. Him and his friends are all excited to join 
    up for the war for Germany. It is a depressing movie that shows 
    how the horrors of war changes someone, how it robs them of their
    soul. It just shows the Germans vs French in the entire film which is mostly accurate.
    The moments of peace being away from the frontlines felt surreal. The sound and cries of men 
    being slaughtered by one other as you see how each one becomes 
    brutal for survival is jarring. At one point of the movie you get 
    to see Paul regret what he has become and tries to become human again.
    Again, it's an artistic masterpiece. I recommend everyone watching it
    to remember history.
