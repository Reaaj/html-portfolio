<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Anthony Rea and I am interested mainly in playing videogames,
   listening to indie music, car culture, learning new languages and coding ^_^</p>

<p>What I value the most is being alone and doing my work with minimal supervision. 
  I believe in helping others when it's needed, because I too need help sometimes 
  when I get stuck somewhere and require the wisdom of someone else. </p>

<p>I am currently here because I motivated myself in trying to get a better career where it
   deals less with people and deals more with technology.</p>
